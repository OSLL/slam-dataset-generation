## Roadmap

### CLI Application
The first goal is to build a CLI app that can generate a random world, generate critical points, generate a trajectory, simulate that trajectory, and save simulated sensor readings into a .bag file


### GUI Application
Once the CLI app is functional, we intend to wrap it in a Qt GUI.  Specifically, we'll add the functionality for a user to adjust/create the worlds, critical point selections, and trajectories.
